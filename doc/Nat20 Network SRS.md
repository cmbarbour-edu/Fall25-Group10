## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the requirements for the Nat20 Network, a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) campaign finder and manager. This document is intended for developers, testers, stakeholders, and system administrators involved in building and maintaining the application. It provides clarity on the system’s goals, features, and constraints to ensure alignment between all parties.

### 1.2 Product Scope
Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Explain what the product that is covered by this SRS will do, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem. 
Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations                                                                                                                                                                          |

### 1.4 References
List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.

### 1.5 Document Overview
This document outlines the Nat20 Network project requirements. Section 2 provides a high-level product overview, including major functions, constraints, user types, and dependencies and section 3 specifies detailed functional and non-functional requirements, including interfaces, performance, security, and compliance considerations.

## 2. Product Overview
This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand.

### 2.1 Product Functions
Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

### 2.2 Product Constraints
User interface must support multiple user roles with appropriate permissions, the platform must provide reliable uptime for campaign discovery. Standards must comply with community safety standards (moderation of inappropriate content), and scalable campaign hosting and account management must be supported.
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements 
FR-SA1: The system shall allow SysAdmins to promote or demote users between roles (Player ↔ DM).
FR-SA2: The system shall allow SysAdmins to deactivate or delete user accounts.
FR-SA3: The system shall allow SysAdmins to reset passwords and assist with account recovery.
FR-SA4: The system shall allow SysAdmins to review and remove inappropriate or inactive campaigns.
FR-SA5: The system shall allow SysAdmins to moderate reported reviews and remove offensive or fraudulent content.

#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
Web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API.

#### 3.1.2 Hardware interfaces
Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.

#### 3.1.3 Software interfaces
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

### 3.2 Non Functional Requirements 

#### 3.2.1 Performance
NFR1: The Nat20 Network system shall consume less than 300 MB of memory. 

#### 3.2.2 Security
Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.

#### 3.2.3 Reliability
Specify the factors required to establish the required reliability of the software system at time of delivery.

#### 3.2.4 Availability
NFR7: The system is going to be available at all times of the day. Maintenance shall be scheduled for low user hours such as 3 A.M EST to reduce the impact that it will have on user experience. 

#### 3.2.5 Compliance
Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations

#### 3.2.6 Cost
NFR8: The expected monetary cost of the project is $0

#### 3.2.7 Deadline
Specify schedule for delivery of the software product.
