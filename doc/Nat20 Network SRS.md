## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
Describe the purpose of the SRS and its intended audience.

### 1.2 Product Scope
The purpose of Nat20 Network is to connect D&D players with dungeon masters and other players to enjoy campaigns. It is intended to provide a clear and easy to use format for dungeon masters to create and share campaigns that they have created with players who might be interested in joining said campaigns. The system is a web-based application aimed at simplifying the process of creating a campaign and finding players who wish to join the group online.

### 1.5 Document Overview
Describe what the rest of the document contains and how it is organized.

## 2. Product Overview
Nat20 Network is a web-based application designed to help D&D players, both new and old, find online campaigns that are open for joining. Players can browse available campaigns, request to join them, create characters, and leave reviews on players and DMs that they have had in the past. DMs can manage their campaigns and players in their group, along with viewing monster status blocks and their player's characters. This system supports multiple user roles including players, DMs, and administrators, each with their own unique experience designed for their specific use-case.

### 2.1 Product Functions
Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

### 2.2 Product Constraints
This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developerâ€™s options. These may include:  

* Interfaces to users, other applications or hardware.  
* Quality of service constraints.  
* Standards compliance.  
* Constraints around design or implementation.
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).
