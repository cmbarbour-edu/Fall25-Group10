## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
Describe the purpose of the SRS and its intended audience.

### 1.2 Product Scope
Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Explain what the product that is covered by this SRS will do, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem. 
Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations                                                                                                                                                                          |

### 1.4 References
List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.

### 1.5 Document Overview
Describe what the rest of the document contains and how it is organized.

## 2. Product Overview
This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand.

### 2.1 Product Functions
Users will be able to create accounts and create characters for DnD campaigns.
Users will be able to create campaigns for others to join via a request to join system.
Users will be able to view DM profiles, and vice versa.
Admins will be able to view user reports and feedback.

### 2.2 Product Constraints
This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developerâ€™s options. These may include:  

* Interfaces to users, other applications or hardware.  
* Quality of service constraints.  
* Standards compliance.  
* Constraints around design or implementation.
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
There will be a main user, which is split into two categories: Player and DM. Users can be both, but they will be logged in as a player unless they create their own campaign and start inviting players to join via a "Campaigns" tab.

Admins are separate from the Users, meaning a user cannot be an admin.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
There is the assumption that the APIs we plan to use may cost this project to take up more space than anticipated, as well as the program being dependent on one of the APIs we plan to use, which is the DnD Player's Handbook API. 

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements 
The "Player" must be able to create an account first before being counted as a player. They also must be able to create a character, whenever it be by themselves or upon entering a campaign via invite, and must be able to do so in a timely manner. They also can view Dungeon Master profiles, as well as give reviews for the campaigns that they join.

#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

Could be further divided into Usability and Convenience requirements.

#### 3.1.2 Hardware interfaces
We plan on having the website be as straight-forward as possible, as we want to have as smooth of a process as possible with character creation and campaign creation. As for the devices that this program will be supported on, we've decided to go with computers only. We do not plan on making a mobile version of this program.

#### 3.1.3 Software interfaces
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

### 3.2 Non Functional Requirements 

#### 3.2.1 Performance
Requirement 2: A novice player shall be able to create a character in under 30 minutes.
Requirement 3: An advanced player shall be able to create a character in under 15 minutes.

#### 3.2.2 Security
The system is going to be available only to those who have created and activated an account.

#### 3.2.3 Reliability
Specify the factors required to establish the required reliability of the software system at time of delivery.

#### 3.2.4 Availability
Specify the factors required to guarantee a defined availability level for the entire system such as checkpoint, recovery, and restart.

#### 3.2.5 Compliance
Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations

#### 3.2.6 Cost
Specify monetary cost of the software product.

#### 3.2.7 Deadline
Specify schedule for delivery of the software product.
