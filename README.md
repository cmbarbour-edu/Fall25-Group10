## Description
A Dungeons and Dragons campaign finder and manager. Dungeon Masters can create custom campaigns for players to join. DMs can also add homebrew content and view useful information about the game. Players can search for public campaigns to join, as well as manage character sheets and view useful information. System Administrators will be able to view user reports, manage reviews of users and DMs, view and delete custom homebrew content, and see usage statistics. The motivation for creating this app is because of the lack of accessible ways to find DnD campaigns online. Without knowing someone who is in a group, it is often difficult to get into DnD. This app helps reduce the barrier of entry, allowing people to easily find open campaigns that they might wish to join.

## App Functions
1. Players (Brycen's role)
 1. Players will be able to create and manage their profile upon logging in or creating an account, as well as create character sheets for use in a campaign.

 3. Players will be able to join (subscribe) to available campaigns, provided that DM accepts their request to join.
 4. Players will be able to write reviews for the DM they played with, as well as other players and homebrew content.
