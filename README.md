## Description
The app we are creating is an app that allows DnD/TTRPG lovers to find campaigns to join in a much easier fashion than other DnD style apps. This app will allow players and DMs to create and manage their profiles, and allow players to join campaigns at the DMs' approval.

## App Functions
1. Players (Brycen's role)
 1. Players will be able to create and manage their profile upon logging in or creating an account, as well as create character sheets for use in a campaign.
 2. Players will be able to view available campaigns created by Dungeon Masters (DMs).
 3. Players will be able to join (subscribe) to available campaigns, provided that DM accepts their request to join.
 4. Players will be able to write reviews for the DM they played with, as well as other players and homebrew content.
