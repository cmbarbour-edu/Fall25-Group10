## Description

> Possible questions to answer here:  What is the motivation for the app? What are the goals of the app/ What problem will the app solve?
A Dungeons and Dragons campaing finder and manager. Dungeon Masters can create custom campaigns for players to join. DMs can also add homebrew content and view useful information about the game. Players can search for public campaigns that they can join, along with managing character sheets and viewing iuseful information. System administrators can view user reports, manage reviews and users, view and delete custom custom homebrew content, and see usage statistics.
The motivation for creating this app is that there is a lack of accessible ways to find D&D campaigns online. Without knowing someone who is in a group, it is often difficult to get into D&D. This app helps reduce the barrier of entry, allowing people to easily find open campaigns that they might wish to join.
