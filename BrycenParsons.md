## About Me
I am a senior at UNCG, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Videogaming and Esports Studies. My hobbies include video-gaming (of course), DnD, Mahjong and bowling, although I do want to try to add one more hobby to the list: horse racing, whenever it be watching horse racing or owning my own racing horse.

## CSC-340 goals
My main goal is to learn how to use GitHub and VS Code, since I have never used these before. My other goal is to learn how to code with a team, whenever it be with one person or two hundred.
