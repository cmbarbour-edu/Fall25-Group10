## About me
I am a junior at UNCG, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Classical Studies. During my free time, I enjoy playing games with my friends, tinkering with old (and occasionally new) electronics, and urbex. I am somewhat of a tech hoarder, attempting to give old technology new life and preventing e-waste from piling up in landfils.  

## My CSC 340 goals
In this class, I want to get a better handle on developing user interfaces, collaborating with others on coding assignments, and working on larger projects. I have not done any of these before, but I want to get a good grasp on what is needed in a professional setting.
