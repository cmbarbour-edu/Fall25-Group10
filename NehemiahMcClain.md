I'm Nehemiah, I'm a senior and this is my second year at UNCG. My major is computer science with a minor in math and biology, I'd like to become a software or game developer after graduation. I enjoy playing basketball, playing video games, and watching tv. My favorite game is 2k, it comes out on friday and I will be on it all weekend.
